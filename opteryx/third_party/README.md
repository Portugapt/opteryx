These are third-party modules which we include into the Opteryx codebase.

- **accumulation_tree** https://github.com/tkluck/accumulation_tree
- **distogram**
- **pyudorandom** https://github.com/mewwts/pyudorandom
- **tdigest** https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/tdigest
- **uintset** https://github.com/standupdev/uintset/

Being in the Opteryx codebase means they are likely to have some deviations from the
original source due to the following reasons:

- Formatting with Black
- Resolving errors with Security Testing
- Resolving errors with Quality Testing

These modules are excluded from maintainability checks.

Other changes may have been made to improve performance or readability.
