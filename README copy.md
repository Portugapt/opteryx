# Opteryx README

[![Opteryx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/main/opteryx-word-small.png)](https://opteryx.dev/latest)

Opteryx is a Python library designed for data wrangling and analytics. With Opteryx, users can seamlessly interact with various data platforms, unlocking the full potential of their data.

## Features

Opteryx offers the following features:

- SQL queries on data files generated by other processes, such as logs.
- A command-line tool for filtering, transforming, and combining files in a flexible and intuitive manner.
- Embeddable as a low-cost engine, allowing for hundreds of analysts to leverage ad hoc databases with ease.
- Integration with familiar tools like pandas and Polars.
- Unified and federated access to data on disk, in the Cloud and in on-prem databases, not only through the same interface, but in the same query.

## Why Use Opteryx?

### Familiar Interface

Opteryx supports key parts of the Python DBAPI and SQL92 standard standards which many analysts and engineers will already know how to use.

### Consistent Syntax

Opteryx creates a common SQL-layer over multiple data platforms, allowing backend systems to be upgraded, migrated or consolidated without changing any Opteryx code.

### Bring your own Data

Opteryx supports multiple query engines, dataframe APIs and storage formats. You can mix-and-match sources in a single query. Opteryx can even `JOIN` datasets stored in different formats, such as Parquet and MySQL.

Opteryx allows you to query your data directly in the systems where they are stored, eliminating the need to duplicate data into a common store for analytics. This saves you the cost and effort of maintaining duplicates.

Opteryx can push parts of your query to the source query engine, allowing queries to run at the speed of the backend, rather than your local computer.

And if there's not a connector in the box for your data platform; bespoke connectors can be added.

### Consumption-Based Billing Friendly

Opteryx is well-suited for deployments to environments which are pay-as-you-use, like Google Cloud Run. Great for situations where you low-volume usage, or multiple environments, where the costs of many traditional database deployment can quickly add up.

### Python Native

Opteryx is Open Source Python, it quickly and easily integrates into Python code, including Jupyter Notebooks, so you can start querying your data within a few minutes. You can use Opteryx to run SQL against pandas DataFrames, and even execute a `JOIN` on an in-memory DataFrame and a remote dataset.

### Time Travel

Designed for data analytics in environments where decisions need to be replayable, Opteryx allows you to query data as at a point in time in the past to replay decision algorithms against facts as they were known in the past. You can even self-join tables historic data, great for finding deltas in datasets over time. (data must be structured to enable temporal queries)

### Fast

Benchmarks on M1 Pro Mac running an ad hoc `GROUP BY` over a 1Gb parquet file via the CLI in ~1/5th of a second, from a cold start. (different systems will have different performance characteristics)
