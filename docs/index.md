# Overview

[Opteryx](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx) is a SQL query engine to query large data sets designed to run in low-cost serverless environments.

## Use Cases

Referencing data from mulitple data platforms into a single query.

Great for use in cost-optimized environments, where a traditional data solution like Hadoop is out of reach.

Querying ad hoc data stores, where data is collected by logging systems and output to storage.

Where you have many different environments, and each would require their own database to query static data.

Where you occassionally query data, and don't want the effort of loading into a database or the cost of maintaining a database for infrequent use.
