# Version 0.1.0

## Differences from Mabel 0.5

**Syntax**
Stricter ANSI SQL compliance

double quotes indicate database identifier
MATCHES
BETWEEN
==
!=

**Query Planning**
Mabel used a brute-force query planner, all steps where executed regardless if it they had meaningful work to do to form the response. Opteryx uses a naive-planner, this only executes steps if they are required, but does so in a fixed order without optimization.
