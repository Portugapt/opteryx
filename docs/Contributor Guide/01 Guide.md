# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Opteryx Contributor Guide.

In this section you will find information to help you to bring your unique skills and experience and join us in building 

Opteryx is primarily written in Python, but you don't need to be a Python developer to contribute. All contributions, [bug reports](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/issues/new/choose), documentation improvements, and [ideas](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx/discussions) are welcome.

## Our Tools

### GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx) to host the code, track feature requests, perform testing, report bugs and maintain documentation.

All submissions, including submissions by core project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.

We have included a number of tests which run automatically when code is submitted to help maintain consistency and quality of the codebase.

Changes should have:
- Corresponding unit/regression tests
- Attributed external sources - even if there is no explicit license requirement
