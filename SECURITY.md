# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The head of the current and previous minor version are supported for functional and security fixes. New features are only added to the latest version. Patch versions are not supported, fixes generally require the creation on a new patch version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.7     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.8     | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 0.6  | :x:                |

All features in supported versions have support to resolve security issues regardless, however features which are due for deprecation may be removed rather than fixed.

Releases may be yanked from PyPI if they contain material bugs, including security flaws.
